      Fly2 - slaughter in the rain; a nasty 2nd play on the game &quot;Fly -
      Giant Breaker&quot;.<br>
      The basics are still the same, try to catch Mr Fly.<br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FF0000">*** note: this game can cause heavy mousebutton
      damage, by playing this game to long ... ;) ***</font><br>
      <br>
      <b>New to Fly2:</b><br>
      * Animations<br>
      * External configuration program<br>
      * Powerup's<br>
      * Renderd game menu<br>
      * Better score<br>
      * New AI<br>
      <br>
      <b>Powerup's and gameplay:</b><br>
      Some new things are added to Fly2.<br>
      <u>Score</u>: One of them, is the score. Not only a nice draw'n score
      counter, but the score depends also on the difficulty settings.<br>
      <u>Clouds</u>: As these crappy things move, Mr Fly can hide behind them<br>
      <u>Health to Mr Fly</u>: Depends on the difficulty settings, Mr Fly has an
      internal health system in Fly2. you must click more then once to get Mr
      Fly.<br>
      <u>Healthpack</u>: Only one at at a time available, but if Mr Fly catch
      this, he gets full health!<br>
      <u>Teleporting: </u>Depends on the difficulty setting. Mr Fly teleports
      him self now (not when you click on him like in Fly - GB). The harder the
      difficulty setting, the more Mr fly will teleport.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Hints and tips:</b><br>
      1) You can work with your 2 mouse buttons (or even 3 if you have a mouse
      like that)<br>
      2) If Mr Fly losses his helmet (the yellow-red thingy), he is almost dead.</font></td>
