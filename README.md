This is the source code for 'Mr. Fly 2 - Slaughter in the Rain' game.
It's a game I wrote back in 2003 in Delphi 7.

The code is public under license of GNU 3.

It still runs on Windows 10 and 11, only the intro screen is slightly off a few pixel.
The rest of the game, works as it should.

This game is a mini-game.
Story : A Fly with a helmet you must try to kill before it reaches the other side of the screen.
Idea : Came about when a Fly flew into my windshield of the car :)
For rendering, it uses GDI+ (includes a tiny mini cursor "backed" in the game).
For sound, it uses native WinAPI. Nothing special!
Config : Uses a seperated tool to configure the game. It is stored in fly2cfg.dat (binary file!).
